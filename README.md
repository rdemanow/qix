QIX - A Classic Screen Saver

## History
I first wrote this in C way back when I was first studying Computer Science.

I have since re-implemented it in several languages, including LISP and,
most recently, JavaScript.

I am currently using it as an exercise in building and maintaining responsive
websites using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Changes
The biggest changes made from its beginnings in C have been re-factoring the
lines as objects, and changing the command line arguments for number of lines
and number of lines per color to sliders the viewer can use to dynamically
interact with the demo

### To Do
[] Make the viewing window auto-resize itself when the size of the viewport changes (e.g. the user rotates their phone/tablet, resizes the browser window, or pops up the developer tools.)
